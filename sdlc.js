// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisOfRequirements = "is a process used to determine the needs and expectations of a new product."

const design = "the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components."

const testingIntegration = "Integration tests are used to test multiple, bigger units in interaction, and can sometimes span multiple systems."

const Implementation = "a library that attempts to bring interfaces to JavaScript in the form of runtime type-checking."

const Maintain = "to modify and update software application after delivery to correct faults and to improve performance."
